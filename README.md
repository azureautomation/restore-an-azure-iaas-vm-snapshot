Restore an Azure IaaS VM Snapshot
=================================

            

This script restores an Azure snapshot created via my Create-AzureVmSnapshot script uploaded recently.  It shuts down the VM, exports out the configuration, removes the VM, discovers the copy of BLOB created via my Create-AzureVMSnapshot script uplaoded
 earlier and finally restores the snapshot and brings up the VM again.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
